# nix-darwin-config

Based on [nix-darwin-kickstarter](https://github.com/ryan4yin/nix-darwin-kickstarter) by @ryan4yin

I have customized this template to my own needs, DO NOT deploy it to your system directly!

## Getting Started

1. Clone this project to `~/.config/nix-darwin`
2. Run `make deploy` in the root to build and deploy

## Configuration Structure

The nix-darwin configuration's structure should be as follows:

```bash
› tree
.
├── flake.lock  # a lock file generated by nix, you can ignore it for now
├── flake.nix   # the entry point of your nix configuration, you need to add your hostname here
├── home        # home-manager's configuration folder, help you manage your dotfiles & user-level apps.
│   ├── bash.nix     # customize bash's dotfiles
│   ├── core.nix     # user-level apps from nixpkgs(nix's official package repository)
│   ├── default.nix  # home-manager's entry point, you need to import all other nix files in home folder here.
│   ├── git.nix      # customize git's dotfiles
│   └── starship.nix  # customize starship's dotfiles
├── Makefile    # a Makefile to simplify your nix-darwin workflow.
├── README.md
├── modules     # a folder contains all your nix-darwin configuration files
│   ├── apps.nix        # contains all your homebrew & nix apps(both GUI & CLI)
│   ├── host-users.nix  # defines your hostname & all your system users
│   ├── nix-core.nix    # nix's core configuration, you can ignore it for now
│   └── system.nix      # defines your macOS's system configuration(like dock, trackpad, keyboard, finder, loginwindow, etc.)
└── scripts
    └── darwin_set_proxy.py  # a script to set http proxy for nix & homebrew.
```
